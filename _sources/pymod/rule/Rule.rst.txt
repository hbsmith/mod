        (Read-only) The number of vertices in the rule.

        :type: int
    .. py:attribute:: vertices

        (Read-only) An iterable of all vertices in the rule.

        :type: :py:class:`RuleVertexRange`
    .. py:attribute:: numEdges

        (Read-only) The number of edges in the rule.

        :type: int
    .. py:attribute:: edges

        (Read-only) An iterable of all edges in the rule.

        :type: :py:class:`RuleEdgeRange`
    .. py:attribute:: left

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the left graph of the rule.

        :type: :py:class:`RuleLeftGraph`
    .. py:attribute:: context

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the context graph of the rule.

        :type: :py:class:`RuleContextGraph`
    .. py:attribute:: right

        (Read-only) A proxy object representing the right graph of the rule.

        :type: :py:class:`RuleRightGraph`
    .. py:method:: makeInverse()

        :returns: a rule representing the inversion of this rule.
        :rtype: :class:`Rule`
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if inversion is not possible (due to matching constraints).
    .. py:method:: print()
                   print(first, second=None)

        Print the rule, using either the default options or the options in ``first`` and ``second``.
        If ``first`` and ``second`` are the same, only one depiction will be made.

        :param first: the printing options used for the first depiction.
        :type first: :class:`GraphPrinter`
        :param second: the printing options used for the second depiction.
            If it is ``None`` then it is set to ``first``.
        :type second: :class:`GraphPrinter`

        :returns: a pair of filename prefixes for the PDF-files that will be compiled in post-processing.
            The actual names can be obtained by appending ``_L.pdf``, ``_K.pdf``, and ``_R.pdf`` for
            respectively the left side, context, and right side graphs.
            If ``first`` and ``second`` are the same, the two file prefixes are equal.

        :rtype: string
        :raises: :py:class:`LogicError` when coordinates are requested, but
                 none can be generated.
    .. py:method:: printGML(withCoords=False)

        Print the rule in :ref:`GML <rule-gml>` format,
        optionally with generated 2D coordinates.

        :returns: the filename of the printed GML file.
        :rtype: string

                 none can be generated.
    .. py:attribute:: name

        The name of the rule. The default name includes the unique instance id.

        :type: string
    .. py:attribute:: labelType

        (Read-only) The intended label type for this rule, or None if no specific label type is intended.

        :type: :py:class:`LabelType`
    .. py:attribute:: numLeftComponents

        (Read-only) The number of connected components of the left graph.

        :type: :cpp:type:`std::size_t`
    .. py:attribute:: numRightComponents

        (Read-only) The number of connected components of the right graph.

        :type: :cpp:type:`std::size_t`
    .. py:method:: isomorphism(other, maxNumMatches=1, labelSettings=LabelSettings(LabelType.String, LabelRelation.Isomorphism))
    
        :param other: the other :class:`Rule` for comparison.
        :type other: :class:`Rule`
        :param maxNumMatches: the maximum number of isomorphisms to search for.
        :type maxNumMatches: :cpp:any:`std::size_t`
        :param labelSettings: the label settings to use during the search.
        :type labelSettings: :py:class:`LabelSettings`
        :returns: the number of isomorphisms found between ``other`` and this rule, but at most ``maxNumMatches``.
        :rtype: :cpp:any:`std::size_t`
    .. py:method:: monomorphism(host, maxNumMatches=1, labelSettings=LabelSettings(LabelType.String, LabelRelation.Isomorphism))
    
        :param host: the host :class:`Rule` to check for subgraphs.
        :type host: :class:`Rule`
        :param maxNumMatches: the maximum number of morphisms to search for.
        :type maxNumMatches: :cpp:any:`std::size_t`
        :param labelSettings: the label settings to use during the search.
        :type labelSettings: :py:class:`LabelSettings`
        :returns: the number of monomorphisms from this rule to subgraphs of ``host``, though at most ``maxNumMatches``.
        :rtype: :cpp:any:`std::size_t`
    .. py:method:: getVertexFromExternalId(id)

        If the rule was not loaded from an external data format, then this function
        always return a null descriptor.

        .. note:: In general there is no correlation between external and internal ids.

        :param id: the external id to find the vertex descriptor for.
        :type id: int
        :returns: the vertex descriptor for the given external id.
                The descriptor is null if the external id was not used.
        :rtype: :py:class:`RuleVertex`
    .. py:attribute:: minExternalId
                      maxExternalId

        If the rule was not loaded from an external data format, then these attributes
        are always return 0. Otherwise, they are the minimum/maximum external id from which
        non-null vertices can be obtained from :py:meth:`getVertexFromExternalId`.
        If no such minimum and maximum exists, then they are 0.

        :type: int
.. py:data:: inputRules

    A list of rules to which explicitly loaded rules as default are appended.

    :type: list of :class:`Rule`

.. py:method:: ruleGMLString(s, invert=False, add=True)

    Load a rule from a :ref:`GML <rule-gml>` string, and maybe store it in a global list.
    The name of the rule is the one specified in the GML string, though when ``invert=True``
    the string ", inverse" is appended to the name.

    .. note::

        If the GML string specifies matching constraints it is currently not possible to invert the rule.
        There is however a configuration option to ignore matching constraints when inverting rules.

    :param string s: the GML string to load a rule from.
    :param bool invert: whether or not to invert the loaded rule.
    :param bool add: whether to append the rule to :data:`inputRules` or not.
    :returns: the rule in the GML string, possibly inverted.
    :rtype: :class:`Rule`
.. py:method:: ruleGML(f, invert=False, add=True)
    
    Read ``file`` and pass the contents to :py:func:`ruleGMLString`.

    :param string f: name of the GML file to be loaded.
    :param bool invert: whether or not to invert the loaded rule.
    :param bool add: whether to append the rule to :data:`inputRules` or not.
    :returns: the rule in the GML file, possibly inverted.
    :rtype: :class:`Rule`
