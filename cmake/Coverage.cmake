# Module for enabling code coverage with gcov and recording information per test case.
# Based on:
# - https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake
# - https://swarminglogic.com/jotting/2014_05_lcov
#
# There are separate concerns:
#
# - Which libraries and executables should spit out coverage information.
# - Which commands/tests should generate coverage info as separate cases.
#
# Usage:
#
# 0. Perhaps redefine the default value of the "BUILD_COVERAGE" option.
#    It defaults to OFF, which means the module reduces to "do nothing".
# 1. include(Coverage)
# 2. for each target (libraries and (test) executables), use
#    target_add_coverage(targetName)
#    to add compile and link flags for generating information from them.
# 3. for each target that implements a test case which should generate separate
#    coverage information, use
#    add_coverage_case(targetName)
#    This adds a new target "targetName_cov" (the suffix can be configred with COVERAGE_TARGET_SUFFIX)
#    which will reset coverage info, run the test case, and save recorded coverage data.
#    The new target is added as a test with the label "coverage" (configurable through COVERAGE_TARGET_LABEL).
#    In ctest, use --print-labels, -L <regex>, and -LE <regex> to view and filter by label.
#    The target also has RUN_SERIAL as property.
#    Note: if you don't want per-test-case coverage, simply use this on a target that depends on all tests.
